    <h3>
        Who am I?
    </h3>
<p>
    My name is Jack Sturzaker, I'm 26 years old and based in Manchester.  I am currently learning foundational front-end as a means of starting a career in UX. I don't come from a tech or even STEM background having grauduated with a degree in History in 2017. Since then, I've done a variety of jobs from teaching English in Spain to waiting tables! 
    <br>
    <br>
    Outside of learning to code, I enjoy cooking (or maybe just eating?) and can be found compulsively checking my fantasy football team every Saturday!
   
</p>

<h3>

     Why am I learning to code?
</h3>

<p>
    I've always been interested by how the way things are designed affect how people interact with them, from public spaces to kitchen appliances.
    <br>
    <br>
    Growing up in the noughties, I have experienced my fair share of cluttered pages with small text that were almost innavigable. What appeals to me about front-end development and UX is that it gives you an opportunity to creatively bridge problems of accessibility through thoughtful and aesthetically pleasing design.
</p>

<h3>
    How am I learning to code?
</h3>
<p>
My first experience of coding was spent banging my head against a wall trying to learn JavaScript in the back-end on Code Academy about a year ago, probably not the best idea as somebody with little experience in logic!
<br>
<br>
Since then, I have had much more luck learning front-end technologies through an 8-week course run by <a href="https://www.madlab.org.uk/" target="_blank">MadLab </a>, a grassroots tech charity based in Manchester. I have also supplemented this with some <a href=https://www.superhi.com/ target="_blank">Superhi</a> courses, an online creative and technology education startup. Combined, these have given me a great foundation in HTML and CSS, as well as a little bit of JavaScript!
